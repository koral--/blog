I’m going to cut to the chase: two of us from the Bitrise team have moved to London a month ago.

> “Yes, London. You know: fish, chips, cup 'o tea, bad food, worse weather, Mary fucking Poppins... LONDON.”

No, no, it’s pretty neat actually. It has a huge tech community, and we wanted to be a part of it, learn from it, and drink ale with as many members of this community as possible. We want to hear the war stories of dev agencies with interesting clients, and learn about the real pain points you have during app development. We’ve already experienced quite a few interesting aspects of London, and after we almost got hit by a taxi after looking in the wrong direction, we decided to share some stories with you, so they won’t go to waste.

>I will write about the great events we attend and the things we learn throughout this epic journey. We will give you a heads-up on twitter before any event we go to. If you happen to attend any of them, feel free to give us a shoutout, so we can chat and have a beer. We also promise that we always bring some Bitrise stickers to give you, to make it worthwhile.

Roughly one and a half month ago we got an increasing number of requests for Bitrise stickers. We were happy to oblige and whipped up a few designs. We were also curious about what you think about them, so we sent out a survey. And then, we sent every person who completed it loads of stickers! Here are a few pics from the guys who received them.

We love that so many of you are so supporting, and we want to bring you along on this ride! We are on a mission to bring back the joy of app development, and that somehow also means that you can have awesome stickers to put on your stuff.

We don’t want anybody to feel left out, so if you think you have just the place for a Bitrise sticker on your laptop, [write us an email](https://www.bitrise.io/contact), and we will send you some!

Next time, I thought I would introduce the team behind Bitrise to prove we are not really robots from space. Stay tuned!

Happy building!
